# Before submitting a pull request

- Open a GitHub **issue** before submitting a PR
- Clone the repo and **install dependencies** with `yarn`
- Run `npm start` to **compile** the backend, frontend and install the app on Android

Hint: the smaller the PR, the more likely it is to be reviewed and merged quickly.
